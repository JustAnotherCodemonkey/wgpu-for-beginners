# Getting Help

_"What does this big red button do? Idk; the manual just titles it 'big red button of doom.'"_

```admonish warning title="Please Note"
Remember that 99% of issues, questions, bugs, etc can be answered by the docs whether those of the crate, the WebGPU spec, or the WGSL spec although much of the official documentation can be rather obtuse and difficult to navigate. Please see [A Word on Documentation](./a_word_on_documentation.md) for more help and details.

## Official Wgpu Resources

Wgpu has a [GitHub Wiki page dedicated to external resources for learning wgpu](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu/wiki/Learning-wgpu). This book eventually hopes to make it on this list.

## The Wgpu Community

Wgpu has several official Matrix spaces. For an up-to-date list of official community hubs, see [the "Community" section of the wgpu repo README](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu?tab=readme-ov-file#community).

```admonish warning title="Please Note"
Out of the currently 4 Matrix rooms linked in the GitHub, note that #wgpu and #naga are primarily for wgpu and naga _development_. For standard users of wgpu, please direct any questions or calls for help in the #wgpu-users room.
```
